# Braille_Reader
Braille Reader can translate a page in Braille to English within seconds. The raised dots of a Braille Page are detected by the Braille Reader which is then cross referenced with the database to get the correct character. At first, the image is convert to grayscale and the shadow is removed. This leaves the image with major colors – the majority of main paper (bit greyish color), the top of the raised dot.





— Braille is a system of raised dots that can be read with the fingers by people who are blind or 
who have low vision. Braille is not a language. Rather, it is a code by which many languages— such as 
English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and dozens of others—may be written and read. Braille is used by 
thousands of people all over the world in their native languages, and provides a means of literacy for all. 
Teachers, parents, and others who are not visually impaired ordinarily read braille with their eyes. But 
not everyone understands Braille; that is where our Braille Reader comes into play.
